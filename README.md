# RiskandCompliance
Automating AWS continuous security control monitoring by using AWS Config, Python, and ServiceNow GRC to engineer and automate risk and compliance for 7 key controls. A GitHub action workflow has been put in place to run the code weekly to review operational status of the controls. The AWS config rules are mapped to CIS controls in ServiceNow GRC through control indicators which are mapped to the AWS asset record. Each run of the code gets the status of each enabled AWS config rule and updates ServiceNow GRC table records. The control indicator that is mapped to each rule will collect the status of the relevant AWS config rules from the updated table to streamline evidence collection, reporting, and risk management.
